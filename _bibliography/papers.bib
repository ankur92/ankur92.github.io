      abstract = {Group-V materials such as niobium and tantalum have become popular choices for extending theperformance of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms allowing for quantum proces-sors and memories with reduced error rates and more modes. The complex surface chemistry ofniobium however makes identifying the main modes of decoherence difficult at millikelvin tempera-tures and single-photon powers. We use niobium coaxial quarter-wave cavities to study the impactof etch chemistry, prolonged atmospheric exposure, and the significance of cavity conditions priorto and during cooldown, in particular niobium hydride evolution, on single-photon coherence. Wedemonstrate cavities with quality factors of Qint ≳ 1.4 × 109 in the single-photon regime, a 15 foldimprovement over aluminum cavities of the same geometry. We rigorously quantify the sensitivityof our fabrication process to various loss mechanisms and demonstrate a 2 − 4× reduction in thetwo-level system (TLS) loss tangent and a 3 − 5× improvement in the residual resistivity over tradi-tional BCP etching techniques. Finally, we demonstrate transmon integration and coherent cavitycontrol while maintaining a cavity coherence of 11.3 ms. The accessibility of our method, which caneasily be replicated in academic-lab settings, and the demonstration of its performance mark anadvancement in 3D cQED.},

  abstract = "{The manipulation of quantum states of light has resulted in significant advancements in both dark matter searches and gravitational wave detectors. Current dark matter searches operating in the microwave frequency range use nearly quantum-limited amplifiers. Future high frequency searches will use photon counting techniques to evade the standard quantum limit. We present a signal enhancement technique that utilizes a superconducting qubit to prepare a superconducting microwave cavity in a nonclassical Fock state and stimulate the emission of a photon from a dark matter wave. By initializing the cavity in an |n=4⟩ Fock state, we demonstrate a quantum enhancement technique that increases the signal photon rate and hence also the dark matter scan rate each by a factor of 2.78. Using this technique, we conduct a dark photon search in a band around 5.965 GHz (24.67  μeV), where the kinetic mixing angle ε≥4.35×10−13 is excluded at the 90% confidence level.}",

  abstract = {Detection mechanisms for low mass bosonic dark matter candidates, such as the axion or hidden photon, leverage potential interactions with electromagnetic fields, whereby the dark matter (of unknown mass) on rare occasion converts into a single photon. Current dark matter searches operating at microwave frequencies use a resonant cavity to coherently accumulate the field sourced by the dark matter and a near standard quantum limited (SQL) linear amplifier to read out the cavity signal. To further increase sensitivity to the dark matter signal, sub-SQL detection techniques are required. Here we report the development of a novel microwave photon counting technique and a new exclusion limit on hidden photon dark matter. We operate a superconducting qubit to make repeated quantum nondemolition measurements of cavity photons and apply a hidden Markov model analysis to reduce the noise to 15.7 dB below the quantum limit, with overall detector performance limited by a residual background of real photons. With the present device, we perform a hidden photon search and constrain the kinetic mixing angle to ε≤1.68×10−15 in a band around 6.011 GHz (24.86  μeV) with an integration time of 8.33 s. This demonstrated noise reduction technique enables future dark matter searches to be sped up by a factor of 1,300. By coupling a qubit to an arbitrary quantum sensor, more general sub-SQL metrology is possible with the techniques presented in this Letter.},

  abstract = {Multimode cavity quantum electrodynamics—where a two-level system interacts simultaneously with many cavity modes—provides a versatile framework for quantum information processing and quantum optics. Because of the combination of long coherence times and large interaction strengths, one of the leading experimental platforms for cavity QED involves coupling a superconducting circuit to a 3D microwave cavity. In this work, we realize a 3D multimode circuit QED system with single photon lifetimes of 2 ms across 9 modes of a novel seamless cavity. We demonstrate a variety of protocols for universal single-mode quantum control applicable across all cavity modes, using only a single drive line. We achieve this by developing a straightforward flute method for creating monolithic superconducting microwave cavities that reduces loss while simultaneously allowing control of the mode spectrum and mode-qubit interaction. We highlight the flexibility and ease of implementation of this technique by using it to fabricate a variety of 3D cavity geometries, providing a template for engineering multimode quantum systems with exceptionally low dissipation. This work is an important step towards realizing hardware efficient random access quantum memories and processors, and for exploring quantum many-body physics with photons.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
