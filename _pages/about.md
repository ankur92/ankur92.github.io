Hi, I am a Research Scientist at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/announcing-the-aws-center-for-quantum-networking/"><b>AWS Center for Quantum Networking</b></a>  focused on developing the control hardware and software for rapid material characterization and manipulation of spin qubits embeded in diamond nano-photonic structures. Previously, I worked with superconducting qubit-cavity systems to build novel detectors at microwave frequencies for quantum sensing applications such as dark matter.

I grew up in Rajasthan, India before moving to Bombay (Mumbai) for my undergraduate studies. For my master's thesis, I studied radiation damage caused by particles from collision events at CERN as they traversed the detector volume.
