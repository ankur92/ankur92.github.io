Hi, I am Ankur Agrawal. I am a Research Scientist at the AWS Center for Quantum Networking focused on developing the control hardware and software for rapid material characterization and manipulation of spin qubits embeded in a diamond memory. Previously, I worked with superconducting qubit and cavity systems for quantum sensing applications such as dark matter.
